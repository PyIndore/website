# GitHub Organization Profile Setup Instructions

## Overview
This directory contains the GitHub organization profile README for PyIndore. When placed in a repository named `.github` within the PyIndore organization, this README will be displayed on the organization's profile page.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create the Special Repository
1. Go to the PyIndore GitHub organization
2. Create a new **public** repository named `.github` (exactly this name)
3. Initialize it with a README if needed

### 2. Upload the Profile Content
1. Create a folder named `profile` in the `.github` repository
2. Upload the `README.md` file from this directory to `profile/README.md`
3. Commit and push the changes

### 3. Verify Setup
- Visit the PyIndore organization page on GitHub
- The profile README should now be displayed prominently

## File Structure
```
.github/                    # Special repository name
└── profile/
    └── README.md          # Organization profile content
```

## Important Notes
- The repository must be named exactly `.github`
- The repository must be **public**
- The profile README must be at `profile/README.md`
- Changes take effect immediately after pushing

## Logo Reference
The README references the PyIndore logo from the main website repository:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyIndore/website/main/images/pyindore-logo.png
```

Make sure the website repository is public and the logo path is correct.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the profile README to:
- Update community statistics
- Add new project highlights
- Modify contact information
- Update community links
- Add seasonal content or announcements

## Testing
You can preview the README locally or on GitHub before making it live by viewing it in any repository's README preview.
